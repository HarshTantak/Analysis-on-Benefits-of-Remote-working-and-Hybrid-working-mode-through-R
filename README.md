# Analysis-on-Benefits-of-Remote-working-and-Hybrid-working-mode-through-R
Project for Inter-University Research convention
The objective of this research project was to investigate the benefits of remote working and hybrid working models. We began by designing a questionnaire to collect primary data from corporate employees across various sectors. Their responses were categorized and labeled, and then analyzed for compatibility with the R programming language using exploratory data analysis techniques to check for outliers.

To predict growing trends among the working class, we utilized Prediction machine learning model. Categorical data was analyzed using chi-square tests, with effective null and alternate hypotheses chosen for the test. We also used Power BI to visualize the results and draw graphical conclusions.

Overall, our research led to several key conclusions. First, we found that remote working is an effective model for employees without negatively impacting their development or progress. Second, we discovered that employees of all age groups can work remotely or from home. Finally, we observed an increase in productivity rates.

This research also addressed other relevant issues, such as traffic congestion, commuting time, pollution, and workplace management. The benefits of remote working were found to include reduced stress, cost-effectiveness, improved performance, and greater flexibility.
